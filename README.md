# Router Manager

This project provides a simple Android application that opens your router's web interface in a WebView. You can type the URL to your router (e.g. `https://10.80.80.1`) and tap **Open Router** to view and manage the router settings from your phone.

## Building

1. Install [Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio).
2. Open this project in Android Studio.
3. Build and run the `app` module on your Android device.

The app requires network access to reach your router. Make sure your phone is connected to the same local network as the router.
